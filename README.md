## Testing

### Browser Testing

Website has been tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox and Opera.

It was tested on two mobile devices OnePlus and Apple Iphone. Both thsts confirmed that website works with limited functionality.

On each browser the website works as intended visually and all the functionality of the website works as intended. 

There is work to be done for full functionality on mobile devices.

### Validators

The website has been through 3 validators:

* JSHint: app.js, components.js and credits.js have been through the validator and no errors have been reported

* W3C Jigsaw: style.css have been through and there are no errors to report.

* W3C HTML: index.html, credits.html and contact.htm have been through and there are no errors to report.

### Local Testing

Local testing of all the buttons links and general functionality of the website has been carried out. Everything
is in a perfect working order and it works as it is intended.

## Version Control

### Git & GitHub

I used **[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)** as a local repository and IDE and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First I created a new repository on GitHub  
* I have then connected my GitHub account and my WebStorm IDE
* I have then opened that repository in WebStorm and started coding
* In WebStorm I have created all the pages and and folders
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* Process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows:
* In the main window of WebStorm click on **Git**
* On drop down menu click on **Commit**
* The commit interface will open on the left side and after adding the commit message click on commit
in the left bottom corner  
* Work is now commited to the master branch
* To push that commit to the **GitHub** I clicked on **Commit and Push** button 
in the same window
* On click on **Commit and Push** button the pop up window will show where I 
needed to confirm that I want to push the work to my GitHub repository

## Deployment

To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Go to **"Settings"** on the repository
2. On **"Source"** of **"GitHub Pages"**, select **"master** for Branch and click save
3. The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on the same section
